# Flax API

That section of documentation contains pages with information about the Flax scripting API, grouped by namespace.

To use this section, you should be familiar with C# scripting.
We also recommend using *Visual Studio* with [Flax Engine Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Flax.FlaxVS) extension installed.

For information about scripting, see the [Scripting](/manual/scripting/index.html) pages in the manual.
