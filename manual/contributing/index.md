We always welcome collaborative participation and community development.
We believe that open source projects have huge potential and provide many opportunities to develop better software.
With that in mind, we open-source many components of the Flax Engine. This includes editor, C# scripting API, and even this documentation.

### Flax Engine

The main repository [Flax Engine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine) contains full source code of the Flax Engine and Flax Editor with all tools and platforms. You can fork it and edit whatever you need. Modified Engine or/and Editor can be used in Flax games production so it can be very handy to have more control over the engine. Also, any pull requests are welcome.

The repository available on Github is a mirror of our internal Git repository hosted on [https://gitlab.flaxengine.com/flax/flaxengine](https://gitlab.flaxengine.com/flax/flaxengine) (mirror updated every 5 minutes). We use our internal LFS server for large binary file hosting. The repository contains `.lfsconfig` file for LFS to work properly but if you encounter issues when pushing changes on your fork try using `git push --no-verify` or migrate to your own LFS server.

If you want to open the Flax Engine in Visual Studio you might need to install [Flax Engine Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Flax.FlaxVS) extension.

### Flax Docs

The documentation you're reading right now is hosted as an open project on Github [here](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxDocs). You can fork it and edit to contribute to the project or report issues there.
