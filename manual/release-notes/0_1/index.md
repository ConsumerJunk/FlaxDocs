# Flax 0.1 release notes

## Highlights

### Decals

![Decals](media/decals.png)

We've added a new material type: **Decal** and new **Decal Actor** which can be used to draw decal materials on top of the surface of the scene geometry. It's a very common and easy way to add special effects like blood drops, footsteps or more. Draw calls rendering is very optimized and fits needs of most of the games. To learn more about decals see the related documentation [here](../../graphics/decals/index.md).

### C# 7.2 support

Now you can use the newest **C# 7.2** features including:
* local functions
* binary literals
* digit separators
* pattern matching
* `out` variables
* expression bodied members
* `ref readonly`
* `private protected`
* and more...

The current Flax version includes [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) compiler and supports using the newest C# language version in your scripts.

### Games UI

New **UICanvas** and **UIControl** actor types enable game developers to create easily UI for game menus, player HUD and other level interfaces like control panels. User Interface can be created from code or right inside the editor with full serialization and undo support.

### Editor Options

Now you can modify the editor options and keep the globally for all installed engine instanced. You can adjust scripts recompilation logic, change the interface, modify the selection outline colors and more.
