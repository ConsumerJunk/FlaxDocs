## Highlights

### Full Source Code Release

![Flax Engine Full Source Code Github](media/github-repo.png)

We did it! We've released the full source code of the Flax Engine including **C++ core** and **C# editor** with all tools and platforms. The sources are available on [Github here](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine). This repository is using *Git LFS* and is a mirror of our internal server. From now on, the previous FlaxAPI repo will be deprecated and we encouruge you to report issues on the new FlaxEngine repo. Also, we're open for Pull Requests so **feel free to contribute**!

Of course, Flax Engine source can be used just like binaries we distribute via Flax Store. It's licensed under our [EULA license](https://flaxengine.com/licensing). For teams that want to use a custom version of the engine feel free to fork it and customize it (helper docs [here](../../editor/advanced/custom-engine.md)).

### New licensing

Along side 1.0 update and source code release we've increased the minimum limit for Flax revenue share from $3,000 to $25,000. Which means that if your game earns $25,000 (or less) per calendar quarter you don't have to pay for using Flax. All sales above it are using 4% revenue share. More info about licensing [here](https://flaxengine.com/licensing).
This change makes Flax cheaper for solo and indie developers.

### Visual Scripting

![Flax Engine Visual Scripting](media/vs-code.png)

One of the key features in this release is a brand new **Visual Scripting** system. Visual Scripts can implement gameplay logic with custom properties just like C# and C++ scripts. This makes game prototyping a lot easier and the engine more accessible for non-programmers.

The editor supports debugging Visual Scripts execution with breakpoints, debugger stepping, local variables, and stack trace.

We also improved the context menu for Visject Surface that is used for materials, particles, animation, and now visual script editing. It runs faster and offers more tooltips for developers.

### Android support

![Android](media/android.jpg)

During this year we've added support for many new platforms such as Linux, PS4, and Xbox Series X/S. Now we're happy to announce **Android platform** support. This includes all engine features: C++, C#, Visual Scripting, **Vulkan** renderer, stereo audio, **multi-touch** input, high-dpi UI, single-click deployment, and much more.

To learn more see the official documentation about [Android platform](../../platforms/android.md).

We've updated all Flax Samples projects to support touch display input and run smoothly on Android devices.

### Vertex Painting

![Vertex Painting](media/vertex-painting.gif)

Editor toolbox just got the vertex painting utility for **coloring models vertices** on the scene. By using it artists can easily enrich the level content for instance by using vertex color masking in the materials. Flax already supports importing vertex colors model meshes.

### Height Layer Blend

![Height Layer Blend](media/height-layer-blend-terrain.png)

The material graph contains now a new node for easier blending between two material layers using the height map which **improves the transition quality**. This can boost the terrain materials quality.

### Foliage Shading Model

When working on the new Flax showcase video we've developed a new shading model shader for **foliage materials**. It improves the look and lighting for thin leaves of bushes, trees, and grass.

### Contact Shadows

![Contact Shadows Rendering](media/contact-shadows.gif)

Another exciting feature is **Contact Shadows rendering** which gives more quality to small objects by adding more precise local shadowing. It's implemented using depth buffer raytracing and works similary to a technique used in Cyberpunk 2077.

### More Editor features

![Cut Scene Rendering in Flax Editor](media/scene_animation_rendering.png)

Every update brings even more features and tools to Editor. This time we did a great job of adding even more of them. Some examples of new useful stuff:
* cut-scenes rendering
* timeline editing improvements
* animation asset tracks editing
* custom scripting languages support
* output log window errors/warning coloring
* undo support for timeline editor
* *BC7* and *BC6H* texture formats importing support (compressed HDR)
* curves editing improvements.

To learn more see the detailed changelog (but it's long as always).
