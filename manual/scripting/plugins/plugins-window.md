![Plugins Window](media/plugins-window.png)

Plugins window is a editor tool used to preview the loaded plugins. You can open it by using menu option **Tools -> Plugins**.

Plugins listed in the window are divided into categories. By double clicking on a plugin author name label, you can navigate to the plugin website for more information or get help.

## Plugin Description

When creating plugins please provide proper description including plugin UI name, info, version and author. You can also customize plugin icon by importing icon into `Content/<plugin_assembly_name>.Icon.flax` (inside plugin project directory). Icon should be a square texture (eg. resolution 128 or 256 px).
