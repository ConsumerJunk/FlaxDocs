One of the most fundamental parts of every game are **animations**. Flax Engine features a high quality and performant animation system that helps developers achieve life-like characters and animations.
This documentation section describes how to work with the Flax animation pipeline. Follow the guidelines and tutorials to create your very own animated characters.
