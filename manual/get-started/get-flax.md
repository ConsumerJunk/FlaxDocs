To install Flax use the **Add Version** button to select the Engine version and installation destination folder. Here you can choose to install packages required to build and deploy your game on different platforms. Finally, press the **Install** button to download the Flax binaries.

Pick the engine version to install by using the *Version* dropdown menu. By default the latest version is selected, but you can change it to get an older engine version (eg. the one that your team is using). Also, it allows to download daily builds from the Github master branch (named `master branch (daily)`). There is a new build every day, which allows you to try new features and bug fixes.
