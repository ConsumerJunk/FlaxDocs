## Software

Flax Engine requires **Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015** to be installed on Windows in order to start. Flax Launcher will check for the missing package and begin installation, however if your game is targeting the Windows platform you should include the redistributable installer with it.

Flax Launcher requires [Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile](http://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/download/details.aspx?id=24872) or higher.
We also recommend using Visual Studio 2013, 2015, 2017 or 2019 for writing code.
