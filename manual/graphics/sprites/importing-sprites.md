# Importing Sprites

The easiest way to import one or more sprites is to drag them from a file *Explorer*  window (or *Finder* on MacOS) to the *Content* window.

Alternatively, you can use the **Import** button in a *Content* window toolbar and then select the files to import.

After choosing the files, the **Import file settings** dialog is displayed. It's used to specify import options per sprite. In most cases the default values are fine and you can just press the **Import** button.

After importing a sprite you will be prompted with a dialogue box for import settings. If this sprite is a sprite atlas, you will need to select the **Is Atlas** option. Additionally, if you wish to import the sprite with transparencies intact, for example from a .png, select the **RBGA** option to include the Alpha channel in the import. After importing the sprite, Flax Editor will convert the sprite to binaries.

The sprite should now be imported.
