| Option | Description |

| **Material** | The decal material. Must have the domain mode set to *Decal* type. |
| **Sort Order** | The decal rendering order. Higher values are rendered later (on top). |
| **Size** | The decal bounds size (in local space). |
| **Draw Min Screen Size** | The minimum screen size for the decal drawing. If the decal size on the screen is smaller than this value then decal will be culled. Set it to higher value to make culling more aggressive. |
