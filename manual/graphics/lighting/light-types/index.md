# Light Types

![Light Types](media/lights.png)

Flax supports 4 different types of lights:

- **Directional** Light
- **Point** Light
- **Spot** Light
- **Sky** Light

Each light type has a little different usage and its own set of properties. This section covers details about them and describes how to use lights in your scenes.
