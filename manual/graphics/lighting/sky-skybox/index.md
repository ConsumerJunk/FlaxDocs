# Sky and Skybox

![Sunset](media/title.png)

Flax has two types of actors that can draw a 3D scene 'background':
- [Sky](http://docs.flaxengine.com/api/FlaxEngine.Sky.html)
- [Skybox](http://docs.flaxengine.com/api/FlaxEngine.Skybox.html)

Using a Sky or Skybox creates a wrapper around your entire scene that shows what the world looks like beyond your geometry.
It really helps realism -- especially with outdoor scenes.
