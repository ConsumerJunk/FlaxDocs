# Global Illumination

![Global Illumination in Flax](media/gi-flax.gif)

**Global Illumination** (shorten as *GI*) is a technique that models how light bounces off surfaces onto other surfaces. This effect is called indirect light transport and is highly complex to compute. Flax supports baking GI into lightmap textures in Editor or using [realtime Global Illumination](realtime.md). This highly improves the overall visual look of the scenes.

Follow this documentation section to learn more about how to use global illumination in your game.
