# Splines

**Splines** are shape actors that define spatial curve with utility functions for general purpose usage. They are a great tool for creating levels and gameplay components such as rail tracks, rivers, ropes, chains, stairs and so on.

Spline is defined by the **bezier curve** points represented as series of transformations in 3D space (with tangents). Points are stored in local-space of the actor. Spline contains a wide scripting API for curve evaluation for procedural objects placement or any other gameplay logic use cases. For instance, you can easily animate object to fly over the spline as shown below.

To learn more about splines follow the dedicated tutorials in this section.
