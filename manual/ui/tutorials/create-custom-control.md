# HOWTO: Create a custom control

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a customized User Interface control for your game. Flax Engine uses UI scripted on a C# side so you can add your own controls and container controls as needed.

## 1. Create `MyControl` script

Add a new script named `MyControl` that will implement the control logic. The C# class needs to inherit from the [Control](https://docs.flaxengine.com/api/FlaxEngine.GUI.Control.html) type. To learn more about creating and using scripts see [this tutorial](../../scripting/new-script.md).

## 2. Edit the script

Open the script file and write the following code:

```cs
using FlaxEngine;
using FlaxEngine.GUI;

namespace Game
{
	public class MyControl : Control
	{
		[EditorOrder(0), Tooltip("The Tint color for the texture. Uses red as default.")]
		public Color TintColor { get; set; } = Color.Red;

		[EditorOrder(1), Tooltip("The texture to be drawn.")]
		public Texture Image { get; set; }

		/// <inheritdoc />
		public override void Draw()
		{
			base.Draw();

			Render2D.DrawTexture(Image, new Rectangle(Float2.Zero, Size), TintColor);
		}
	}
}

```

As you can see, it exposes a texture property and the tint color used for rendering. Use [Render2D](https://docs.flaxengine.com/api/FlaxEngine.Render2D.html) to perform custom rendering tasks. You can also override all control events to provide any other custom logic for your UI. Feel free to experiment.

## 3. Spawning the `UI Control`

Now spawn a new *UI Control* to the scene and set its type to **MyControl** as shwon in a picture below.
To learn how to do so, see the related [tutorial here](create-ui.md).

## 4. Test it out!

Finally, adjust the exposed properties of the control and see the final results.
