# Virtual Input

**Virtual input** is a Flax feature used to unify the input data across different input devices and runtime platforms. It helps with cross-platform development and adds a convenient abstraction layer between raw input devices and the game scripts. It's highly configurable and can be used in all games made with Flax.

This documentation covers the usage and important parts of the virtual input interface.

## Settings and usage

The first step to use the virtual input is preparing a proper configuration. This is done via the **Input Settings** asset. You can learn more about creating and using these settings on the [Input Settings](input-settings.md) page. If you're using one of the *Flax Templates* it should already contain a proper configuration file in `Content/Settings/Input Settings.json`. Open this asset in the Editor.

As you can see in the above image there are several configurations in that file. For instance, `Left Mouse Button` and `Gamepad button A` are configured to trigger the input action named `Fire` (even triggered on `Press`).

Then in your C# script you can handle this action:

```cs
public override void OnUpdate()
{
	if (Input.GetAction("Fire"))
	{
		ShootBall();
	}
}
```

Also you can use [InputEvent](https://docs.flaxengine.com/api/FlaxEngine.InputEvent.html) and [InputAxis](https://docs.flaxengine.com/api/FlaxEngine.InputEvent.html) classes to configure it further:

```cs
public InputEvent FireEvent = new InputEvent("Fire");
public InputAxis MouseX = new InputAxis("MouseX");

public MyScript()
{
	// Register for input action event
	FireEvent.Pressed += ShootBall;
}

public override void OnUpdate()
{
	// Read the virtual axis value
	var mouseX = MouseX.Value;
	...
}

public override void OnDestroy()
{
	// Remember to dispose the action object (it holds reference to your methods)
	FireEvent.Dispose();
	MouseX.Dispose();
}
```

Then if you select the object with this script in Editor you can modify the `FireEvent` and `MouseX` mapping's names so they can be modified without editing the code.
