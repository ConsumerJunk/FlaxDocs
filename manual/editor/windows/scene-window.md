# Scene Window

![Scene Window](media/scene.jpg)

The **Scene Window** shows a tree control with full hierarchy of the loaded scenes that updates automatically and supports multi-scene editing. 
Actors spawned or removed at runtime and all level changes are updated in real-time.

Every actor is represented by a tree node (named after the actor).
Scene actors are the root nodes of the tree.
You can expand and collapse the scene hierarchy by using the arrow icons on the left of the node names.
To select one or more nodes use **LMB**, **Ctrl + LMB** or **Shift + LMB** to select a range of nodes.

You can select and drag an actor or selection of actors to reorder and reparent them.

## Context menu

Using **right-click** will display the context menu for the selected actor node. 
This will allow you to copy, paste, cut, duplicate, delete and add new actors.
