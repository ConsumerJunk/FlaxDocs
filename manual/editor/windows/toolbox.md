# Toolbox

The **Toolbox** window helps with rapid object spawning, level designing and advanced scene editing.
It contains several modes, each contained in a separate tab.
You can switch between these modes by clicking on their corresponding icon (plus icon, brush icon, etc.).

## Spawning

The default and most used toolbox mode is **Spawning**.
In this mode you can add new actors to the scene by dragging them into the [viewport](viewport.md) or [scene window](scene-window.md).
Actor types are grouped into categories so you can quickly find the desired object.
