# Linux

## Technical information

Flax is compiled for Linux platform using **Clang** compiler and uses **X11** for UI. Binaries are tested on Ubuntu 18 and 20.

If your device has multiple GPUs installed you can select one using the cmd line argument: `-nvidia`, `-intel`, or `-amd`. Flax uses **Vulkan** for rendering.

If your game build runs on Linux as a server build then you can pass `-mute -null -headless -std` command line arguments to disable specific features (audio, graphics, window, log to std). To elarn more about command line access see [this page](../editor/advanced/command-line-access.md).
